## 🧠 OOP Principles Demonstrated

| Principle    | Description                                                                |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Inheritance  | `Rectangle` and `Circle` inherit from the base class `Shape`.              |
| Abstraction  | `Shape` class provides a common interface for all shapes.                  |
| Polymorphism | `Display` method can be overridden by derived classes.                     |
| Interface    | `IShape` enforces the implementation of `CalculateArea` across all shapes. |
